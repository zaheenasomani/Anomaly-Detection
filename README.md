# Anomaly-Detection
Find anomaly based on the size of clusters

Supervised Machine Learning
Using K-means cluster divide the data into clusters
Use the anomaly detection fucntion to find the anomalies based on the size of cluster

Hybrid Unsupervised Machine Learning
Use ensemble classifiers to use different models to train and find the accuracy of the model
